# Playbulb
tools for communication with Playbulb led lights (Candle, Rainbow,..)

This is a collection of documentation and code snippets to use/control the [Playbulb](http://www.playbulb
.com/en/index.html) series of LED lights from [MiPow](http://www.mipow.com/en/index.html)

At this point we can only provide some information on the Candle product line, as this is the only one we have so far.
But looking at how they all work, and if we can get hold of other lights, we should be able to extend this collection.

* Protocol information
** [Candle](protocol/candle.md)
* [Some general stuff](General.md)
* [Examples](Examples.md)

# Todo

* Further investigate BT protocol
* Some odd things to check (setting effect only last a few seconds)

If anyone has other HW out of the Playbulb series, feel free to get in touch with us, so we can add other models.
